# Cyberlearner_Project-Network_Remote_Control

Creating automation that would allow user to run script from their local devices but would be executed by the remote server. Communicating with a remote server and executing task anonymously.

Attached word doc shows the intended actions of the script.

Bash NR.sh to run script.

Do note that you have to provide a remote server on your own. I was given a template Ubuntu to work o the project.
